# Expense-Tracker
A lightweight, offline-first personal expense tracker that automatically calculates daily expenditures, cycle averages, and highest spend/balance. Users only enter the remaining amount each day; the app handles calculations, stores data locally, supports multiple cycles, and maintains a history with all-time metrics.
